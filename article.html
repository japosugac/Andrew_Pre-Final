      <h2 class="h5">Would I agree to the 40k wedding documentation deal?</h2>
      <p class="text-muted small">If I were organizing my wedding, I wouldn’t immediately say no to a documentation team asking for 40,000 pesos just because they use an iPhone 16 Pro Max and CapCut. For me, the tools they use are not the main basis for pricing. What matters more is their skill and the quality of the final output. If their portfolio already proves they can deliver clean shots, stable footage, and good storytelling even with mobile equipment, then it’s fair to consider the price.</p>
      <p class="text-muted small mb-0">A team with two years of experience and an above-average portfolio tells me that they know their workflow, understand lighting and framing, and have developed their own editing style. If their sample work matches the kind of wedding video I want, then the 40k can be worth it. But if the quality doesn’t match the price, then I’d negotiate or look for alternatives.</p>

    <section class="mb-4 reveal">
      <h2 class="h5">Integrity behind their work</h2>
      <p class="text-muted small">Integrity means being transparent about what you offer, what tools you use, and what results the client should expect. If the team is honest from the start and doesn’t pretend to use gear they don’t have, that already shows professionalism. What matters more is that they deliver consistent quality, meet deadlines, and communicate clearly. A creator can have expensive gear and still produce average results, while someone with simpler tools but strong skills can deliver excellent work.</p>
      <p class="text-muted small mb-0">So for me, integrity comes from the way they work and how they treat the project, not just the equipment they hold. If they take the job seriously and give their best effort, their work has value.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4 reveal">
      <h2 class="h5">Reflection on “vibe coders” and creativity</h2>
      <p class="text-muted small">The idea of “vibe coders” reminds me of people who rush through tasks, copy shortcuts, or rely too heavily on tools without understanding how to do things properly. They can produce something quickly, but the quality usually doesn’t last. This is similar to creators who depend on equipment to make their work look good, but without real technique behind it.</p>
      <p class="text-muted small mb-0">On the other hand, real developers and real creatives put in the effort to understand their craft. They study the basics, practice consistently, and pay attention to details. Their creativity and skill show in the results, no matter what tool they use. This is why I’d still consider hiring the 40k team — because the tool doesn’t define the value; the skill and integrity of the person using it does.</p>
