              <p>Generative AI refers to systems designed to produce new content — text, images, audio, videos, or even code — by learning from large datasets. Unlike traditional AI that mainly classifies or predicts, generative models “create” something new based on patterns learned during training.</p>
              <p>According to Microsoft’s AI 101 resource, Generative AI works by identifying structures in training data and then using those learned patterns to output original responses. These outputs aren’t random; they follow statistical relationships that the model learned, which is why the content can feel coherent and relevant to the prompt given.</p>

              How does it work?

              <p>Generative AI models — especially large language models (LLMs) — work by predicting the most likely next token or piece of data. Microsoft explains that these models undergo two stages: *training* and *inference*. During training, the model processes billions of examples, learning how words, sentences, and ideas connect. It essentially learns probability patterns in human language.</p>
              <p>During inference (when a user types a prompt), the model uses what it learned to generate new content. A key factor is the “transformer architecture,” which allows the AI to understand context efficiently. The output depends on sampling methods like temperature and top-k, which shape how creative or factual the response becomes.</p>

              <p>Based on the Zapier resource, examples of generative AI tools include text-generation models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), image generators (Midjourney, DALL·E), video tools (RunwayML), coding assistants (GitHub Copilot), and audio/music generators. These platforms use their own generative models to create content in different formats.</p>
              <p>Zapier highlights that these tools help with productivity, creativity, automation, and prototyping. Many apps now integrate AI features directly into their services, making generative AI accessible even to people with no technical background — writers, designers, students, and business owners can all benefit from its capabilities.</p>

              <p>The University of Leeds states that generative AI is very effective for producing drafts quickly, summarizing long information, generating ideas, enhancing creativity, and providing immediate examples for learning. It can handle repetitive writing tasks, propose solutions, or create unique outputs such as images or charts.</p>
              <p>Its strength comes from speed and scale — it can process and generate huge amounts of information much faster than humans. Leeds also emphasizes that GenAI works best when paired with human review, meaning it amplifies productivity but should not fully replace critical thinking or decision-making.</p>

              <p>The ICAEW article highlights major limitations such as hallucination (AI generating false but confident-sounding information), bias from training data, lack of transparency, and potential copyright issues. Because models are trained on huge datasets with unknown origins, they may unintentionally reproduce inaccurate or biased content.</p>
              <p>Another risk is over-reliance. ICAEW notes that users may assume AI is always correct, which can lead to the spread of misinformation. Verification and human oversight are essential — especially in academic, legal, or technical tasks where accuracy matters.</p>

              How is Generative AI different from traditional AI?

              <p>Traditional AI systems are typically designed to classify, predict, or optimize based on existing data — for example, spam filters that categorize emails or recommendation engines that suggest products. These systems analyze inputs and produce a decision or classification.</p>
              <p>Generative AI, on the other hand, creates entirely new content. Instead of just recognizing patterns, it uses those patterns to produce original outputs like text, images, music, or code. While traditional AI might tell you "this email is spam," generative AI can write a completely new email from scratch.</p>

              Can Generative AI replace human creativity?

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Generative AI is a powerful tool that can assist and augment human creativity, but it cannot fully replace it. AI generates content based on patterns learned from existing human-created works — it remixes and recombines, but it doesn't truly "understand" or have original intent the way humans do.</p>
              <p>Human creativity involves emotion, lived experience, cultural context, and intentional meaning. AI can help brainstorm ideas, generate drafts, or explore variations quickly, but the final creative direction, judgment, and purpose still come from humans. Think of GenAI as a creative assistant, not a replacement.</p>

              <p>Generative AI models are trained on massive datasets collected from the internet and other sources. This includes books, articles, websites, images, code repositories, and more. The exact composition of training data varies by model and is often not fully disclosed by companies.</p>
              <p>This raises important considerations: the AI may have learned from copyrighted material, biased content, or outdated information. Users should be aware that AI outputs reflect the patterns in its training data, which is why verification and critical thinking remain essential when using AI-generated content.</p>
